Hello, I'm Ted, a 21-year-old soon-to-be graduate of Saint Petersburg University of Telecommunication. 
I possess a strong foundation in programming languages such as C++, Python, and R, with a keen interest in neural networks and game development. Additionally, I have acquired proficiency in database management systems like MongoDB, SQL, and system analytics.
My journey into web development began six years ago, and since then, I've been deeply invested in this field. I am particularly passionate about frontend development and am currently enhancing my skills through the RSSchool Frontend course. My ambition is to become an expert in frontend development, and I plan to delve into modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue while gaining real-world project experience.
Prior to this, I completed the ITMO web development course, which provided me with valuable insights and knowledge. Additionally, I participated in UpSkillMe Epam courses last year to further refine my skills.
One of my notable projects involved creating a website for a mental arithmetic school, where I handled HTML layout and CSS styling. However, the most challenging project for me was developing a website for English language learning targeted at children.
I consider myself to be diligent and adaptable, always eager to learn and grow. My dedication to my work is reflected in my commitment to my long-standing involvement in dance for over 15 years. I approach tasks with a determined mindset, consistently striving to achieve my goals.
In terms of language proficiency, I have actively practiced with native speakers during my travels, attaining a B2 level. I am continually honing my language skills to reach higher levels of fluency.
